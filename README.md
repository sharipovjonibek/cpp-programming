# OOP-lab

Basic C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab assignments, covering fundamental concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

# Lab_01

1.	Print “Welcome to IUT”.
2.	Declaring Variable and Printing its Value
	(Hint: one variable of each type like: int, float, double ,char).
3.	Write a program to Calculate Area of Square. 
	(Hint: take input from user.)

# Lab_02

1.	Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard and prints the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of these numbers.
( Hint: Please do not use the min and max functions.)
2.  Write a program that calculates the squares and cubes of the integers from 0 to 10. Use tabs to print the following neatly formatted table of values:

 (Hint: Please generate this table without employing a for loop.)

3.  Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling. The application should input the following information and display the user’s cost per day of driving to work: 

    a) Total km driven per day.  
    b) Cost per liter of gasoline.  
    c) Average km per liter.  
    d) Total cost per day.

    (Hint: Total cost per day = (total km / average km) * cost per liter)
