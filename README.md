# OOP-lab

Basic C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab assignments, covering fundamental concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

# Lab_01

1.	Print “Welcome to IUT”.
2.	Declaring Variable and Printing its Value
	(Hint: one variable of each type like: int, float, double ,char).
3.	Write a program to Calculate Area of Square. 
	(Hint: take input from user.)

# Lab_02

1.	Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard and prints the sum, average, product, smallest and largest of these numbers.
( Hint: Please do not use the min and max functions.)
2.  Write a program that calculates the squares and cubes of the integers from 0 to 10. Use tabs to print the following neatly formatted table of values:

    (Hint: Please generate this table without employing a for loop.)

3.  Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling. The application should input the following information and display the user’s cost per day of driving to work: 

    a) Total km driven per day.  
    b) Cost per liter of gasoline.  
    c) Average km per liter.  
    d) Total cost per day.

    (Hint: Total cost per day = (total km / average km) * cost per liter)

# Lab_03

1. Write a program to calculate tax, given the following conditions: 

If salary is less than 2000 USD then no tax will be zero. 
If salary is in the range of 2001 to 3000 USD (2001<=salary<3000) then tax will be charged with rate of 20%. 
If salary is in the range of 3001 to 5000 USD (3001<=salary<5000) then tax will be charged with rate of 30%. 
If taxable income is above 5000 then tax will be charged with rate of 40%. 

(Hint: formula for tax is: (salary *rate)/100. You need to display two things: 
Tax payable. Income after tax deduction)

2. Write a program to test whether a number entered is odd, even or zero. 

3. A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions: 
a. Hardness must be greater than 50. 
	b. Carbon content must be less than 0.7. 
	c. Tensile strength must be greater than 5600. 

The grades are as follows: 
If all three conditions are satisfied then Grade will be 10. 
If condition (a) and (b ) are satisfied then Grade will be 9. 
If conditions (b) and ( c) are satisfied then Grade will be 8. 
If conditions (a) and (c) are satisfied then Grade will be 7. 
If any one condition is satisfied then Grade will be 6. 
If none of the conditions are satisfied then Grade will be 5. 
Write a program which will require the user to input values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel and print the grade of steel according to the given conditions.
